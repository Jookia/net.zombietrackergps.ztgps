This is a quick attempt at making a Flatpak for ZombieTrackerGPS!

How to build and install:

```
git clone https://github.com/Jookia/net.zombietrackergps.ztgps
cd net.zombietrackergps.ztgps
./build.sh
```

Building takes 8 minutes on my computer with a Ryzen 3700X.

License of packaging files are CC0, ZombieTrackerGPS is GPLv3-or-later.
